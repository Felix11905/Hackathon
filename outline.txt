Although colourblindness is talked about alot nowadays it is still one of the subtle disabilities that people never get to know about.
We designed a short test to get to know if you are colour blind and specefically which type.


It is currently not much mostly due to inability to create more complex codes but what we have in our minds would be a test that could very accurately
tell which type of colourblindness you suffer from paired with a colour scheme changer which using the data from the test can be set up to make the the
colour scheme for devices more user friendly. 
It doesn't impact accessibility much since colourblind people are not exactly unable to see but having that wee bit more colours on the screen definitely
makes it much more interesting to go web surfing, that we all can agree on.


The colour scheme thing being difficult to create is planned to be created a step at a time first going from just a photo you give it to website to browser
to device.


And thats all there is to this small project.
